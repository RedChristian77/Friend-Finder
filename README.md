## Purpose

The main purpose of this app was created to have people fill out a direct people to a short survey where it would go up against the database, and figure out based on commonality of the questions and find someone with similiar likes. The project if further built upon could be use in the sense of tinder but more for friendships or whatever thing you would want a friend to be based around.

## How to

The app leads you to the main page of a button where it leads you to the survey where it will ask you a series of 10 questions of how you feel about them. Afterwards it runs through the database and tests to see the user with the most compatibility.

## Contributers

I, Christian Breyer, created the entirety of this app with the sole purpose of learning for school.
As the app was created as a way of learning express along with a few other things, it will no longer be updated with the exception of fixing the HTML of the page and testing a few things on a different branch.
